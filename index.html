            <h1>life is better with friends</h1>
            <p>We have people in our lives who can goof too, people we can get crazy with, and people who we equally
                hate and love ‚Äì all the same. If you don‚Äôt these kinds of people in your life, then you need to go out
                more and build relationships more. Look for the people who will tell you all you need to know without
                sugar coating things.

                Be with real persons who will love you for who you are and aren‚Äôt afraid to call your bluff.
